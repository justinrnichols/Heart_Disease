## Preface

The ultimate goal of this project was to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not. The data was split into a training and testing set in order to compare the performance accuracy of each of the 5 predictive models used. The main objective was to find the accuracy score of each model and see which predictive analysis algorithm was the most accurate at predicting heart disease based on the data provided. The predictive models used include Linear Regression, Logical Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and SVC. The data used within this predictive application contains patient health data from https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci.


## Problem Definition

For more than a decade, heart disease has been the primary cause of death in the United States. Hundreds of thousands of people each year die from heart disease. For many cases, the individual was unaware that he or she was showing signs of heart disease until after they had suffered a major health problem. To solve this problem, our group wanted to create a heart disease predictive model that will aid doctors, nurses, and other health professionals to determine whether a patient is likely to suffer from heart disease based on their current health status. With this prediction, a physician can further access the patient and determine whether further medical action is necessary such as medical scans and tests, medication, or lifestyle changes. By using 6 different predictive models, this project aims to find the most accurate prediction to use for a real-world setting.


## How to Use the Predictive Model

1. Go to Google Colab and upload the Jupyter notebook (i.e. heart_disease_prediction.ipynb). 
2. If the dataset does not automatically load into the notebook, it will need to be manually added to Google Colab using the folder icon on the left-hand side. 
3. Click “Runtime” from the navigation bar and hit “Run all” to execute all the cells within the notebook. 
4. After all cells are executed, the 5 predictive models, their plots, and their accuracy scores will be generated.
